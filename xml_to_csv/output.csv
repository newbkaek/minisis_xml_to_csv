The box camera was a logical follow up from the original simple camera obscuras, often having only one shutter speed, simple lenses with minimal f-stop capabilities and manual winds. \n \n The trend arguably began with George Eastman's in 1888 with the first, amateur, handheld camera, ""The Kodak"", which came pre-loaded with 100 exposures.  After exposure, the entire outfit was returned to the Eastman Kodak company, where the film was developed, prints made and sent back to the customer with the camera, now re-loaded with more film.\n \n Many millions of similar cameras were sold, both high and low end, manufactured by different companies and eventually developing into the modern point-and-shoot camera. \n \n \n <br><br>   \n To browse the individual items in this series, click on the ""View the list"" link under the ""File and item records are available for this series"" title (to the right of the page).
